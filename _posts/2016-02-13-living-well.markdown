The greatest gift is time. The greatest choice is time well spent.

One spends time well by choosing the activities that give her the greatest joy in the present or in the future.

I find joy in these particular actions:

1. playing
2. moving
3. learning
4. creating
5. eating
6. giving
7. resting
