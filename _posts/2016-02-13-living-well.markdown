The greatest gift is time. The greatest choice is time well spent.

One spends time well by choosing the activities that give her the greatest joy in the present and in the future. I find joy in six particular areas.

1. The joy of eating
2. The joy of moving
3. The joy of learning
4. The joy of playing
5. The joy of creating
6. The joy of giving
